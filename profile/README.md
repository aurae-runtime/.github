# Aurae Runtime

This is the GitHub organization that holds the various projects that help bring Aurae to life. The primary 2 projects worth noting are:

 1. The [aurae](https://github.com/aurae-runtime/aurae) shell and frontend componenent which is what application owners will interact with.
 2. The [auraed](https://github.com/aurae-runtime/auraed) core daemon which serves as the kernel from the project. 
 
 Aurae draws immense inspiration from Kubernetes, Google Borg, Linux, Systemd, and various other runtime components in the hopes of simplifying a distributed platform.
 
 The easiest way to get started is to get the `auared` daemon running on a system, and to then run a simple `auare` script against it.
